## Objective
The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a person has diabetes based on a set of medical variables.

## Project structure
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Exploratoy data analysis (EDA)
4. Modeling and evaluation
    - Models
        - Logistic Regression
        - K-Nearest Neighbors
        - Support Vector Machine
    - Evaluation
        - F1-Score
    
## Question
1. Is it possible to accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes using diagnostic
variables such as number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin levels and age?

## Findings 
- Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an F1-Score of 0.7234.
- The EDA revealed no strong correlation between the number of pregnancies and diabetes outcome.
- Glucose levels and BMI had a stronger relationship with the target variable.
